## Deep Generative Models Final Project

#### Abstract

We propose the use of modern deep generative models for the purpose of bootstrapping new syn-thetic datasets from existing data. Specifically, we explore Generative Adversarial Networks and Deep Boltzmann Machines for generating new images that can be used in place of original data for training models. Initial results on the MNIST dataset suggest that this is a effective method and could potentially be a powerful tool in privacy sensitive domains such as medicine.

#### Notes
This was the final project for my Machine Learning course. The slides included were used for our final presentation, and the paper was submitted as the final report.
