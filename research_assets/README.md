## Probabilistic Dynamics Research

#### Description

During my time at Swarthmore, I was involved in research with Dr. Amy Graves that will soon be published. We investigated pedestrian dynamics, and looked into ways to model how pedestrians move through various systems. Using statistical tools like probability distribution functions, complementary cumulative distribution functions, and power law fitting techniques, and languages like Java and MATLAB, we were able to identify key factors that can lead to jams. This is useful in the context of designing exits in buildings and city transportation infrastructures. This project improved my confidence in learning new materials independently, how to seek help efficiently, and produce results in a timely manner. This project yielded preliminary results about applying power-law fitting techniques to new systems, and a paper discussing these findings will be published in Fall 2018.

#### Notes

The two posters highlight the work of my collaborators and I, and were presented at major conferences.
